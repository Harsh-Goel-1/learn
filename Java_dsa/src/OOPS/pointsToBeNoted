classes do not take up space in heap, they are just blueprints through which objects are created in heap.

'this' refers to the current object

finalize() is called by gc to destroy objects

in java internal implementation, every class that you create is inherited from Object class,
it is not considered inheritance or something though

super() calls the constructor of immediate parent class

this.thingy checks if thingy exists in the child, if not then check in parent
