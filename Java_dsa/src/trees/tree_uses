trees have log n insert/delete/search,
scalable, no re structuring on inc data size

used in file systems, databases, network routing path finding algo, solving maths
decision trees in ml, compression of files, heaps, graphs

terminology - child parent edge height level siblings
complete binary tree -> all levels full, last level full from left to right
full/strict binary tree -> either 0 or 2 children
perfect binary tree -> yeah, exactly
skewed -> yeah that worst case asshole, only 1 child
height balanced -> avg height log n   eg- avl, red, black
ordered binary tree, each node has property, eg- bst
